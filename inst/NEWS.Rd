  \itemize{
    \item{Added the new function designRandomize with the intention that it will eventaully replace fac.layout. The new function replaces the arguments \code{unrandomized} and \code{randomized} with \code{recipients} and \code{allocated}, respectively, and \code{nested.factors} with \code{nested.recipients}. Also, it changes the default for \code{unit.permutation} to \code{FALSE}.}

Added arguments \code{marginality} and \code{check.marginality} to allow the marginality matrix to be supplied, overwriting any that is produced by pstructure.formula. The argument \code{check.marginality} allows one to decide if the supplied and calculated marginality matrices are the same. Methods for as.data.frame, marginality and print were added for objects of class \code{pstructure}.}

    \item{Modified the function designAnatomy to accomodate the changes to pstructure. Added new argument \code{labels} to designAnatomy, which has option \code{sources} that will result in sources indicating whether they represent interactions and/or nested effects. Added argument \code{marginality} that allows a list of marginality matrices to be supplied. Added the argument \code{check.marginality} allows one to decide if the supplied and calculated marginality matrices are the same. }
    \item{Added argument \code{labelswap} to summary.pcanon so that can swap between terms and sources in the output.}
    \item{Added new method marginality.pcannon to extract the list of marginality matrices corresponding to the \code{formulae} in the call to designAnatomy. Added the argument \code{labelswap} to the summary.pcanon method so that either terms or sources can be output.}
    \item{Added the oats split-plot design from Yates (1937).}
  }
}
\section{Changes in dae version 2.7-26 (2017-05-04)}{
