\title{Data for an experiment to investigate nitrogen response of 3 oats varieties}
\description{
Yates (1937) describes a split-plot experiment that investigates the effects of three varieties of oats and four levels of Nitrogen fertilizer. The varieties are assigned to the main plots using a randomized complete block design with 6 blocks and the nitrogen levels are randomly assigned  to the subplots in each main plot.

The columns in the data frame are: Blocks, Wplots, Subplots, Variety, Nitrogen, xNitrogen, Yield. The column xNitrogen is a numeric version of the factor Nitrogen.
The response variable is Yield.
